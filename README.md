# Decision-Tree
A from-scratch implementation of Decision Trees in Python. This project demonstrates the core concepts of decision tree algorithms, including entropy calculation, information gain, and tree construction. It's a great resource for those learning about machine learning and classification algorithms.

# Decision Tree Implementation from Scratch

This repository contains a Python implementation of Decision Trees built from scratch. The project aims to provide a clear understanding of the fundamental concepts behind decision tree algorithms.

## Features

- Entropy calculation
- Information gain computation
- Best feature selection
- Tree construction
- Prediction on new data

## Files

- `Decision-Tree.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation and examples

## Usage

To use this implementation:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter notebook
3. Run the cells to see the decision tree in action

## Learning Outcomes

This project helps in understanding:

- How decision trees make splits
- The role of entropy and information gain
- The process of recursive tree building

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute!
